            This project has its roots back in <strong>2008–2009</strong>, when I, Nik Nenkov, was learning web development.<br><br>
            I used CodeIgniter to build and deploy small web apps on a shared hosting account provided by my local internet provider in Gabrovo.<br><br>
            Back then, I was experimenting with SQL, creating simple web pages to store data, manage homework, and support my gaming hobbies—like Counter-Strike 1.5, MU Online, World of Warcraft, Diablo, and other private server games.<br><br>
            This site is a reflection of those early days and how far web development has come. Thank you for visiting!
